## 🔍 Intrusion Detection with Snort
Snort is an open-source IDS/IPS that helps monitor and prevent malicious network activity. Below are the steps to install and configure Snort on Ubuntu.

### 📌 Steps to Install & Set Up Snort
#### Step 1: Install Snort
```bash
sudo apt-get install snort -y
```
- Set `HOME_NET` to your network (e.g., `192.168.0.0/24`).
- Verify installation:
```bash
snort --version
```

#### Step 2: Enable Promiscuous Mode
```bash
ip a  # Check network interface
sudo ip link set <your_network_interface> promisc on
```
Replace `<your_network_interface>` with your actual interface name.

#### Step 3: Configure Snort
```bash
sudo cp /etc/snort/snort.conf /etc/snort/snort.conf.backup
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
```
Set `HOME_NET` to your network range.

#### Step 4: Add Custom Rules
Edit `local.rules` to define custom detections:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
```
Example rule to detect pings:
```bash
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg: "ICMP PING DETECTED"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

#### Step 5: Run Snort
```bash
sudo snort -q -l /var/log/snort -i <your_network_interface> -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```
When Snort detects a ping, it logs and alerts administrators.

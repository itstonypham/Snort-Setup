## üìå Overview
Comprehensive Guide to Snort Intrusion Detection and Prevention Setup.  
<br>

## üê∑ Why Use Snort?
Snort is a popular, open-source Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) that monitors network traffic to spot and stop suspicious activity, keeping systems safe. This guide will help you set up and run Snort on Ubuntu.  
<br>

## ‚ú® How This Helps
- **Real-Time Monitoring**  
Snort watches network traffic and alerts to any suspicious activity.

- **Customizable Alerts**  
Rules can be tailored to detect specific threats relevant to the network.

- **Community Rules**  
Regular updates help stay protected against new threats.  
<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
### Step 1: Install Snort
- Open the terminal and install Snort:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install snort -y
   ```
- Set HOME_NET to your network (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24).
- Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   snort --version
   ```

  ### Step 2: Enable Promiscuous Mode
- Check your network interface:

   ```bash
   ip a
   ```
- Enable Snort to see all network traffic:
    ```bash
   sudo ip link set <your_network_interface> promisc on
   ```
- Replace <your_network_interface> with your network interface name.

  ### Step 3: Configure Snort
- Snort files are in /etc/snort. Make a backup:

   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/snort/snort.conf /etc/snort/snort.conf.backup
   ```
- Edit snort.conf to set HOME_NET to your network range:
    ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
    ```

  ### Step 4: Add Custom Rules
- Open local.rules to add custom rules:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
   ```
- For example, add a rule to detect pings:  
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg: "ICMP PING DETECTED"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

  ### Step 5: Run Snort
- Start Snort to see alerts in real-time:

   ```bash
   sudo snort -q -l /var/log/snort -i <your_network_interface> -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
   ```
- Replace <your_network_interface> with your network interface name.
- When Snort spots a ping request, it triggers an alert saying "ICMP PING DETECTED" and logs details about it. This helps keep an eye on any unusual activity on the network.
